# UFO Sightings

## Overview
The request from a client was to display a table organizing UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. The client wanted the ability to filter by multiple criteria creating a dynamic website. The table was created using JavaScript, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to modify the aesthetics of the website.

## Results
#### Welcome to the UFO Sightings webpage. This is the general look of the webpage.

#### This is what it looks like with the filters popoulated:
To engage with the filters, you would type in one of the fields with the desired filter and then hit the enter button. You have to make sure everything is in lower case letters and there are no spaces at the end of the text string. You can use more than 1 search field at a time.

## Summary
#### Drawbacks:
The main drawback is that you have to know specifics to use these filters. You have to know that it is all lowercase lettering that is used. Also some of the filters might not be intuitive, such as the shapes. Light is not a shape but is used in this table.

#### Recommendations:
1. Adding a trim function to the search fields would be helpful. This would eliminate the spaces at the end of the text string and help the search. 

2. A date range filter feature would be beneficial. People might want to see multiple days at a time or could be looking for a specific event but not know an exact date.
